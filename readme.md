# Fabric Perm Hider Kotlined

Command Hider is a Fabric mod that adds permission overrides to **all commands,
even modded ones**. This means that you can now block players (even ops!) from
using certain commands, or even allow players to use commands they wouldn't
normally have access to.

Please note that you will need a permission manager such as [LuckPerms](
https://luckperms.net) installed in order to use this mod. Any permission
manager that supports the [Fabric Permissions API](
https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api) should work.

this project is based on https://github.com/LoganDark/fabric-command-hider

but has a new feature, command permission are group by mod name, like (minecraft:command.spawn, myModId:command.myModCommand)
Also written in kotlin and will keep up to date in the future
